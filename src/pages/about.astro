        Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emmanuel. Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±.
        <br />

        Seems you just discovered my personal space on the internet. Enjoy!
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience building
        applications for the web. I'm currently working at <Link
          href="https://tecmie.com"
          text="Tecmie"
          classes="link"
        />
        as a Partner. I'm passionate about building products that solve problems
        and make people's lives easier.
        <br />
        I also enjoy building tools for other developers. I'm a big fan of open source
        and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        In my free time, I like to journal. I read <Link
          classes="link"
          href={user.goodreads}
          text="books"
        /> too. My interest spans across thrillers and African literatures.
        <br />
        I listen to quite a couple of (seemingly random) collection of songs that
        may seem chaotic to you but I like them anyway. <br /> I also enjoy watching
        sitcom, documentaries, and detective series.
