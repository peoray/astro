        Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emmanuel and welcome to my Digital Garden. I'm passionate
        about Open Source and Learning in Public.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        I'm a Product Engineer with over 5 years of experience with a track
        record in building complex applications on a global scale with tools
        such as Javascript, Nodejs, Vuejs (2 & 3), Nuxt, MySQL, MongoDB and
        other modern technologies.
      </p>

        {' '}
        I'm experienced in different industries such as SaaS, B2C, B2B, start-ups
        and scale-up stage companies. Worked with different teams large and small,
        as well as teams in different geographical zones. Familiar with agile/scrum
        development process and have used tools such as Jira, Notion, Zoom, Slack,
        Asana, Basecamp, Google suite, etc.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        I'm an active contributor to open source projects. I'm a core team
        contribitor to{' '}

      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        In my free time, I like to journal. I read <Link
          classes="link"
          href={user.goodreads}
          text="books"
        /> to music, playing chess when I can, hanging out with friends and family,
        reading books, and doing my best to learn the Guitar.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        I listen to quite a couple of (seemingly random) collection of songs
        that may seem chaotic to you but I like them anyway. <br /> I also enjoy
        watching sitcom, documentaries, and detective series.
      </p>

      I also like listening to music and going on cycling trips with friends.
